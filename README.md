# QABF 

This repository consists on a docker-composer file to create a simple environment involving Sonarqube, Metabase and a PostgreSQL database. The objective of this framework is to empower teams in their quality code analysis, by using a Sonarqube to analyze e provide insights about their code. Also, I use Metabase to create analytic dashboards to complement Sonarqube analysis.
